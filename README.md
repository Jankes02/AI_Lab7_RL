# AI_Lab7_RL
The project contains a game called Frozen Lake and AI using the Q-learning algorithm implemented in Python. It was created as part of the Artificial Intelligence course at Gda≈Ñsk University of Technology. The repository contains 3 "main" scripts: **play.py** (manual gameplay), **train.py** (RL model training) and **test.py** (test a previously trained model). Feel free to switch up the "render" parameter in train.py to suit your needs and **q_agent.py** (hyperparameters of the Q-learning model).

Note: I am not the author of the game itself, just the artificial intelligence.
